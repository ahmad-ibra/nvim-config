# nvim-config

My current .config/nvim setup.

Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) and [this accompanying repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) by ThePrimeagen.

## Prerequisits
1. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

2. Setup Packer

Install Packer by running this
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
Next, hop into nvim at `~/.config/nvim` and run `:PackerSync` to download everything
